# NASAHUNCHEC
NASAâ€™s passion has inspired us to possibly help the future of space exploration. We plan to achieve this through the communication gifted to us by the application of discord. With our environmental sensor subsystem, we seek to provide our own designs and technology to develop a safe and comfortable environment for people in space, using relevant and modern technological techniques to ensure the health and success of future NASA missions and other scientific endeavours in space. By concentrating our efforts on a specific subsystem, we hope to create a thoroughly developed project, with no bugs or safety hazards, that reflects the time and effort put into creating it.
