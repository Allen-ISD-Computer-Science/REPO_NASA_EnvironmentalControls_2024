            <h4>Our Goals:</h4>
            <p>We aim to develop a usable and practical product that can be easily applied and utilized by NASA. 
                The final product should have working features that both align with the parameters set with NASA and express
                our own creativity and skills. Through this project, we seek to deepen our knowledge and correct any misunderstandings we may have
            had about subjects relating to technology and engineering. Through creative problem solving and efficient communication,
            we hope to improve our coordination skills and gain valuable experiences that we can learn from in the future

            <h4>Documentation of Our Journey</h4>
            <p> <b>November:</b> The Github Page was set up, and the team began formulating the vision for the project.</p>
            <p> <b>December:</b> The Github Projects page was created along with user stories, and the preliminary UI designs for the GUI was set up.
                While schoolwork and final exams did take some time out of the schedule and progress of the project, research was done on what materials should be used
                and design elements of the project.
            </p>
            <p><b>January:</b> Work began on the the GUI. Intially, there was some minor issues when it came to setting everything up
                and programming correctly. However, once the basics were understood, the coding process was fairly smooth. 
            </p>
            <p><b>February:</b> Once the GUI was finished, the main focus became connecting the GUI to the hardware, along with preparing
                to present the project. Some of the work went into designing a Trifold along with other things that would help present the project.
            </p>
            <p><b>March:</b> We started preparing to move away from the Arduino IOT Cloud. We started finding ways on how to connect our react-native gui to our
                Arduino. Right now, sending data from the Arduino to a server and then back to our GUI seems like a good idea.</p>
            <p><b>April:</b> We connected our Arduino to our react-native GUI. We can send Arduino data to a data set called firebase and then back to our react-native gui.
                This is very good as now we have a customizible gui, and we're not stuck with the Arduino IOT Cloud.</p>

            <h4>Our thought process</h4>
            <p>
                When starting the project, we approached from a practical point of view and mold our design around the idea of practicality and usability. 
                From the beginning of the project, we were focused on crafting a UI that was easy to understand and use so that anyone could access it. 
                Therefore, while the UI is not the most complex, it was designed to be somewhat more simplistic, in case it needed to be used quickly, or by someone who wasnt familiar with it. 
                Our thought process when it came to constructing was similar, in that we focused initially on making the product work. While we werent as familiar with the hardware as we were with the software, 
                approaching the work from this point of view helped us simplify things so that we would make a product without getting as caught up in the details too soon.
